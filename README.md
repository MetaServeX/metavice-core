Intro
---------------------
Metavice is a multi-chain service network for Metaverse, dedicated to developing decentralized services and generating universal basic income (UBI) for everyday people through developing decentralized financial platforms and services, without the need for interference by intermediaries. 

SERVE is the native token of the Metavice network. SERVE set its goal across multiple chains and in an ecosystem of passive income aggregators, to become a DeFi platform (ServeSwap), a decentralized service provider (ServeDAO), and a multi-chain ecosystem.

In order to establish a sustainable ecosystem, SERVE develops a system through the following three phases: 

- Phase I (completed): 
Build a DeFi platform with features including swapping, liquidity farming & staking. This is an initiative of the system and foundation going towards a complex ecosystem.

- Phase II: 
Build Decentralized Services (dSVs), where users interact with the dSV providers to earn incomes. dSV providers generate revenues via interacting with other crypto projects. The revenues will be distributed to participants through the staking port.

- Phase III: 
Build a multi-chain ecosystem consisting of dSV apps deployed across multiple blockchains, as well as bridges between those apps to allow for the seamless flow of liquidity & dSVs across isolated services. This includes services on the Polygon, Arbitrum, OKEx and HECO chains.
